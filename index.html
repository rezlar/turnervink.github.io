        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm in my final year of high school at Thomas Haney Secondary in Maple Ridge, BC. After I graduate I plan (after upgrading some math) to apply for the Computer Systems
        Technology progam at BCIT. I've been passionate about technology since the first time I touched a keyboard at 5 years old. In my spare time I like to make watchfaces for
        the Pebble smartwatch. I've featured some of them below!</p>

            <h3>Square</h3>
            <p>Packed with features, Square is a simple watchface that can suit anyone's needs! Pick any colour combination, have the middle bar display the battery level,
              have a weather forecast shown when you flick your wrist, all the time, or not at all, and choose your preferred date format. Square also has support for multiple
              languages, currently English, French, Spanish, and German.</p>
