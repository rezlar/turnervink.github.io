    <p class="p1">I'm a high school senior in the Vancouver area with a passion for technology.
    As I hobby I enjoy creating watch faces and apps for the Pebble smartwatch,
    some of which you can find below. I'm hoping to pursue a Computer Systems
    Technology diploma, followed by a BTech Degree at BCIT after I graduate.</p>
